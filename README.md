# Goodbye-Lattes
A project about decryptr and the Lattes' Captcha. We want to use Lattes' data to analyze Brazillian scholars profile at the Law School of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. 

The first step of this project is to classify the Lattes's CAPTCHA database, using decryptr.
The second step is to create a training model of this database.
The third step it to create a crawler, which searches Lattes and downloads its xml.
The fourth step is to parse the xml. 
The final step is to use this Captcha breaker with getLattesData, in order to start our research.
